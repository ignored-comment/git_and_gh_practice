Back around 2012, I was able to visit Haiti.

It was a beautiful country - but devastated as a result of the earthquake that had happened a few years ago.

The people were strong, despite living in a nation that was logistically and politically broken.

I saw a vibrant people, although those poor were poor and in need of positive change.

One day my hope is that Haiti becomes an envy of the Caribbean nations, where others come to learn and grow.
